## Quick note on the messiness of Day 3
This is probably the messiest code I've ever written in my life and I'm tired and I just wanna go to sleep so I won't be commenting it right now and honestly even if I did it would not make it any easier to understand. There is literally the nastiest if statement in the world in part 1 and a long if/else statement in part 2 that probably could've been a switch but I didn't feel like looking up how to implement switch cases in python. Most of the solutions I read after the fact also use grids/mapping which I also do not know how to do in Python. I also did not even realize there is a way to import the input from an AoC library until reading those solutions.

I may return in the future to clean this up/comment it out, however in the off chance anyone reads these solutions in the meantine, my sincerest apologies and I promise you I do not normally code like this. With all that being said, believe it or not these programs will indeed give you the right answers so they're not completely useless I guess.
